Integration Guide

I recommend putting the EngineRoom folder in the parent directory
beneath your project folder.

Now open your project, select the project and choose
Add -> Existing files.

OSX:
Navigate to EngineRoom/EngineRoom-OSX and choose EngineRoom-OSX.xcodeproj

Do not tick "Copy".

On opening the new entry it should reveal EngineRoom.framework.

Create a new Copy Files Build Phase with target "Frameworks" and drag the
framework to it (from the EngineRoom project ).

Option-Drag the framework from there to your targets 'Link Binary with Libraries'.

Open the inspector for your target, Tab "General", 
add EngineRoom-OSX as a dependency.


Optional:
Open your MainMenu NIB and add an NSObject, set its class to EngineRoom,
this will provide you with a LogPoint Menu.
If you prefer a MenuItem, add one and connect EngineRoom's engineRoomMenuItem outlet to it.
And try clicking the item.

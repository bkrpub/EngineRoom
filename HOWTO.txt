Integration Guide

I recommend putting the EngineRoom folder in the parent directory
beneath your project folder.

Now open your project, select the project and choose
Add -> Existing files.

OSX:
Navigate to EngineRoom/EngineRoom-OSX and choose EngineRoom-OSX.xcodeproj

On opening the new entry it should reveal EngineRoom.framework.

Open the inspector for your target, add EngineRoom-OSX as a dependency.
Drag the framework from the EngineRoom project to 'Link Binary with Libraries'
for your target.

Create a new Copy Files Build Phase with target "Frameworks" and drag the
framework to it (from the EngineRoom project as before).

Optional:
Open your MainMenu NIB and add an NSObject, set its class to EngineRoom,
this will provide you with a LogPoint menu.
